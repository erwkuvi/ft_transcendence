### 1. Obtain SSL/TLS Certificates

- **Self-Signed Certificates**: For development purposes, you can create self-signed certificates. However, for production, it's recommended to use certificates from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) like Let's Encrypt.

### 2. Configure Django Settings

Ensure your Django settings are configured to support HTTPS:

- **Security Settings**: Update your security settings to enforce HTTPS.

```python
# Security settings
SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT = True  # Redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS
SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS = 31536000  # Enable HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
SECURE_HSTS_INCLUDE_SUBDOMAINS = True
SECURE_HSTS_PRELOAD = True
SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True
CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = True
```

- **Certificate Paths**: Ensure the paths to your certificate and key files are correctly set.

```python
KEY_PATH = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'certs/privkey.key')
CERT_PATH = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'certs/fullchain.crt')
```
### 3. Use a Web Server

For production, it's recommended to use a web server like Nginx or Apache to handle SSL/TLS termination. Here's a basic setup for Nginx:

- **Nginx Configuration**: Create an Nginx configuration file for your Django project.

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name yourdomain.com;

    ssl_certificate /path/to/fullchain.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/privkey.key;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomain.com;
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}
```

- **Explanation**:
  - The first server block listens on port 443 for HTTPS connections and uses the specified SSL certificate and key.
  - The second server block listens on port 80 and redirects all HTTP requests to HTTPS.

### 4. Run Django with SSL in Development

For development, you can use the custom `runsslserver` command you created earlier to run Django with SSL:

```bash
python manage.py runsslserver --use_ssl
```

### 5. Test Your Setup

- **Local Testing**: Access your application via `https://localhost:443` to ensure it's working over HTTPS.
- **Production Testing**: Ensure your domain is correctly pointing to your server and test the HTTPS connection.

### Additional Considerations

- **Firewall**: Ensure your server's firewall allows traffic on port 443.
- **Environment Variables**: Ensure all necessary environment variables (e.g., `CLIENT_ID`, `CLIENT_SECRET`) are set correctly.

By following these steps, you should be able to configure your Django project to work over HTTPS both in development and production environments. If you encounter any specific issues, feel free to ask for further assistance!
